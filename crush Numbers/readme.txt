 
Take number such as 3467. 
To 'crush' it, you just have to subtract from it the sum of its digits. Which yields 3467 - (3 + 4 + 6 + 7) = 3447.
You can crush it again: 3447 - (3 + 4 + 4 + 7) = 3429.
You can crush it again and again until if no longer is a positive integers. 
 
Write C++ program that takes a number n as an input and returns the number of crushes it takes before the number is no longer positive. 
 
Example 1
Input:
57
Output:
6
 
Explantion: Self evident.  57 -> 45 -> 36 -> 27 -> 18 -> 9 -> 0
