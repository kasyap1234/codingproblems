Consider a directed graph whose vertices are numbered from 1 to n. There is an edge from a vertex i to a vertex j iff either j = i + 1 or j = 3 * i. The task is to find the minimum number of edges in a path in G from vertex 1 to vertex n.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 9
Output:
2
Explanation:
9 -> 3 -> 1, so
number of steps are 2.
