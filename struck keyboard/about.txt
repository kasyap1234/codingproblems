You are given two strings typed and target. You want to write target, but the keyboard is stuck so some characters may be written 1 or more times. Return whether it's possible that typed was meant to write target.

Constraints

n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of typed
m ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of s
Example 1
Input
typed = "aaabcccc"
target = "abc"
Output
true
Explanation
Each of the "a", "b", and "c" were typed
Example 2
Input
typed = "abc"
target = "ab"
Output
false
